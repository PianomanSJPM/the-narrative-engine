# SoloHeart Project Status - July 4, 2025

## Executive Summary

The SoloHeart project has undergone a major cleanup and enhancement phase, resulting in a significantly improved character creation system with LLM integration, immediate fact commitment, and live character sheet updates. The project is now cleaner, more maintainable, and provides a much better user experience.

## Major Achievements

### 1. Project Cleanup (2025-07-04)
**Problem Solved:**
- Project had accumulated 50+ redundant files and 4 duplicate directories
- Complex project structure with multiple versions of similar functionality
- Difficult navigation and maintenance
- Confusing file organization

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Comprehensive Archive**: Created `archive_2025-07-04/` with organized subdirectories
- **Redundant Files**: Archived 50+ files including interfaces, launchers, configuration, docker, tests, documentation, and data files
- **Duplicate Directories**: Archived 4 duplicate project structures
- **Preserved History**: All files safely archived with detailed recovery instructions
- **Clean Structure**: Simplified project hierarchy with clear active vs archived separation

**Archive Structure:**
```

```

### 2. Enhanced Character Creation System
**Core Innovation:**
- **LLM-Powered Extraction**: Uses Ollama's llama3 model for semantic understanding
- **Immediate Fact Commitment**: Facts committed directly to character sheet, no staging
- **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time updates as player describes character
- **Robust Fallback**: Pattern matching when LLM extraction fails
- **Guided Completion**: Intelligent transition to guided questions only when ambiguous

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Fact Extraction**: Extracts name, race, class, background, age, gender, alignment, personality, motivations, trauma, gear, combat style simultaneously
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only commits high-confidence facts
- **Context Awareness**: Uses surrounding text to infer missing information
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies when facts need confirmation
- **Live Updates**: Character sheet updates in real-time

### 3. LLM Integration with Ollama
**Implementation:**
- **Primary Method**: Ollama llama3 model for semantic understanding
- **Structured Output**: LLM extracts facts into JSON format
- **Fallback System**: Pattern matching when LLM extraction fails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to pattern matching

**Example LLM Extraction:**
```json
{
  "name": "Kaelen Thorne",
  "race": "Human",
  "class": "Fighter",
  "background": "Soldier",
  "age": 35,
  "gender": "Male",
  "alignment": "Neutral Good",
  "personality_traits": ["Loyal", "Distrustful of authority"],
  "motivations": ["Justice", "Revenge"],
  "combat_style": "Massive hammer, leather apron armor",
  "trauma": "Lost forge in raid, scarred arm",
  "gear": ["Massive hammer", "Leather apron"]
}
```

### 4. Immediate Fact Commitment System
**Innovation:**
- **No Staging**: Facts committed directly to character sheet
- **Live Updates**: Real-time character sheet updates
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Only asks for confirmation when truly ambiguous
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Configurable for different fact types

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates confusion about pending vs committed facts
- Provides immediate feedback to player
- Reduces cognitive load during character creation
- Maintains natural conversation flow

### 5. Live Character Sheet
**Features:**
- **Real-time Display**: Character sheet updates as you type
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of captured facts
- **Missing Fields**: Shows what's still needed
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### 6. UI Improvements
**Changes Made:**
- **Simplified Flow**: Removed "Vibe Code" terminology from user interface
- **Campaign Start**: Only asks for campaign name and character creation
- **Live Updates**: Character sheet updates in real-time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Technical Architecture

### Enhanced Fact Extraction Pipeline
```
Player Input → LLM Extraction → Pattern Matching → Immediate Commitment → Live Character Sheet
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓                ↓
Natural Language → Semantic Analysis → Regex Patterns → Character State → Real-time Updates
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓                ↓
Freeform Description → Context Understanding → Fact Extraction → No Staging → Instant Feedback
```

### LLM Integration
```python
class OllamaLLMService:
    def __init__(self, model_name="llama3"):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.base_url = "http://localhost:11434"

    def extract_character_facts(self, text: str) -> Dict:
        """Extract character facts using LLM semantic understanding"""
        prompt = self._build_extraction_prompt(text)
        response = self._call_ollama(prompt)
        return self._parse_llm_response(response)
```

### Pattern Matching Fallback
```python
def extract_all_facts_from_text(text: str) -> Dict:
    """Extract all possible character facts with confidence scoring"""
    facts = {}
    
    # Extract with confidence scoring
    if name := extract_name_from_text(text):
        facts['name'] = name
    if race := extract_race_from_text(text):
        facts['race'] = race
    # ... more extractions
    
    return facts
```
