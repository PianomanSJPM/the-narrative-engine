# SoloHeart Project Status - July 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

The SoloHeart project has achieved significant milestones in both architectural integrity and feature development. The Narrative Engine has been successfully made domain-agnostic, character creation is working reliably, and game-specific features like inspiration points and saving throws have been implemented. The project now demonstrates a clean separation between core narrative functionality and game-specific mechanics.

## Major Achievements

### 1. Narrative Engine Domain-Agnostic Integrity (2025-07-05)
**Problem Solved:**
- Narrative Engine core contained domain-specific logic and game mechanics
- Integration layer was passing game-specific fields as top-level data
- Engine was making autonomous decisions about data filtering
- No clear separation between universal metadata and game-specific state

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Core Engine Cleanup**: Removed all domain-specific logic from Narrative Engine core
- **Integration Layer Refactoring**: Proper separation of universal vs game-specific fields
- **Memory Layer Architecture**: Established episodic, semantic, procedural, and emotional memory layers
- **Game Features Implementation**: Added inspiration points and saving throws support in integration layer
- **Architectural Integrity**: Maintained clean separation between core engine and game features

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before: Core engine making domain-specific decisions
def add_character(self, character_data):
    # Domain-specific filtering logic here
    if 'level' in character_data:
        # Game-specific processing
        pass

# After: Core engine accepts any data structure
def add_character(self, character_data):
    # No filtering, no domain-specific logic
    character = Character(**character_data)
    return character.id
```

**Integration Layer Design:**
```python
# Universal fields (go to top level)
CHARACTER_FIELDS = {
    'id', 'name', 'description', 'traits', 'goals', 'conflicts', 
    'relationships', 'development_arc', 'current_state', 'background',
    'personality_matrix', 'emotional_state', 'memory_ids', 'last_updated'
}

# Domain-specific fields (go to current_state)
domain_specific_fields = [
    'race', 'class', 'background', 'alignment', 'age', 'gender',
    'level', 'hit_points', 'armor_class', 'initiative', 'experience',
    'combat_style', 'gear', 'spells', 'abilities', 'skills',
    'personality_traits', 'motivations', 'emotional_themes', 'traumas',
    'relational_history', 'backstory', 'inspiration_points', 'saving_throws'
]
```

### 2. Game-Specific Features Implementation
**Inspiration Points Support:**
```python
def set_inspiration_points(self, character_name: str, points: int) -> None:
    """Set inspiration points for a character (stored in current_state)."""
    char = self.engine.get_character_by_name(character_name)
    if not char:
        logger.warning(f"Character '{character_name}' not found.")
        return
    current_state = dict(getattr(char, 'current_state', {}) or {})
    current_state['inspiration_points'] = points
    self.engine.update_character_state(character_name, current_state)

def get_inspiration_points(self, character_name: str) -> int:
    """Get inspiration points for a character."""
    char = self.engine.get_character_by_name(character_name)
    if not char:
        return 0
    current_state = getattr(char, 'current_state', {}) or {}
    return current_state.get('inspiration_points', 0)
```

**Saving Throws Support:**
```python
def set_saving_throws(self, character_name: str, saving_throws: Dict[str, int]) -> None:
    """Set saving throw modifiers for a character."""
    char = self.engine.get_character_by_name(character_name)
    if not char:
        logger.warning(f"Character '{character_name}' not found.")
        return
    current_state = dict(getattr(char, 'current_state', {}) or {})
    current_state['saving_throws'] = saving_throws
    self.engine.update_character_state(character_name, current_state)

def get_saving_throws(self, character_name: str) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Get saving throw modifiers for a character."""
    char = self.engine.get_character_by_name(character_name)
    if not char:
        return {}
    current_state = getattr(char, 'current_state', {}) or {}
    return current_state.get('saving_throws', {})
```

### 3. Project Cleanup (2025-07-04)
**Problem Solved:**
- Project had accumulated 50+ redundant files and 4 duplicate directories
- Complex project structure with multiple versions of similar functionality
- Difficult navigation and maintenance
- Confusing file organization

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Comprehensive Archive**: Created `archive_2025-07-04/` with organized subdirectories
- **Redundant Files**: Archived 50+ files including interfaces, launchers, configuration, docker, tests, documentation, and data files
- **Duplicate Directories**: Archived 4 duplicate project structures
- **Preserved History**: All files safely archived with detailed recovery instructions
- **Clean Structure**: Simplified project hierarchy with clear active vs archived separation

**Archive Structure:**
```

```

### 4. Enhanced Character Creation System
**Core Innovation:**
- **LLM-Powered Extraction**: Uses Ollama's llama3 model for semantic understanding
- **Immediate Fact Commitment**: Facts committed directly to character sheet, no staging
- **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time updates as player describes character
- **Robust Fallback**: Pattern matching when LLM extraction fails
- **Guided Completion**: Intelligent transition to guided questions only when ambiguous

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Fact Extraction**: Extracts name, race, class, background, age, gender, alignment, personality, motivations, trauma, gear, combat style simultaneously
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only commits high-confidence facts
- **Context Awareness**: Uses surrounding text to infer missing information
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies when facts need confirmation
- **Live Updates**: Character sheet updates in real-time

### 5. LLM Integration with Ollama
**Implementation:**
- **Primary Method**: Ollama llama3 model for semantic understanding
- **Structured Output**: LLM extracts facts into JSON format
- **Fallback System**: Pattern matching when LLM extraction fails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to pattern matching

**Example LLM Extraction:**
```json
{
  "name": "Kaelen Thorne",
  "race": "Human",
  "class": "Fighter",
  "background": "Soldier",
  "age": 35,
  "gender": "Male",
  "alignment": "Neutral Good",
  "personality_traits": ["Loyal", "Distrustful of authority"],
  "motivations": ["Justice", "Revenge"],
  "combat_style": "Massive hammer, leather apron armor",
  "trauma": "Lost forge in raid, scarred arm",
  "gear": ["Massive hammer", "Leather apron"]
}
```

### 6. Immediate Fact Commitment System
**Innovation:**
- **No Staging**: Facts committed directly to character sheet
- **Live Updates**: Real-time character sheet updates
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Only asks for confirmation when truly ambiguous
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Configurable for different fact types

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates confusion about pending vs committed facts
- Provides immediate feedback to player
- Reduces cognitive load during character creation
- Maintains natural conversation flow

### 7. Live Character Sheet
**Features:**
- **Real-time Display**: Character sheet updates as you type
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of captured facts
- **Missing Fields**: Shows what's still needed
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### 8. UI Improvements
**Changes Made:**
- **Simplified Flow**: Removed "Vibe Code" terminology from user interface
- **Campaign Start**: Only asks for campaign name and character creation
- **Live Updates**: Character sheet updates in real-time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Technical Architecture

### Domain-Agnostic Narrative Engine
```python
class NarrativeEngine:
    def __init__(self, campaign_name: str):
        self.campaign_name = campaign_name
        self.characters = {}
        self.memories = {}
        self.context = {}
    
    def add_character(self, character_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Add character without domain-specific filtering."""
        character = Character(**character_data)
        self.characters[character.id] = character
        return character.id
    
    def get_context_for_llm(self, character_name: str) -> str:
        """Provide narrative context to LLM."""
        # Domain-agnostic context surfacing
        pass
```

### Enhanced Fact Extraction Pipeline
```
Player Input → LLM Extraction → Pattern Matching → Immediate Commitment → Live Character Sheet
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓                ↓
Natural Language → Semantic Analysis → Regex Patterns → Character State → Real-time Updates
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓                ↓
Freeform Description → Context Understanding → Fact Extraction → No Staging → Instant Feedback
```

### Game-Specific Integration Layer
```python
class SoloHeartNarrativeEngine:
    def __init__(self, campaign_name: str):
        self.engine = NarrativeEngine(campaign_name)
    
    def record_character_creation(self, character_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Record character with proper field separation."""
        # Separate universal vs domain-specific fields
        universal_fields = {k: v for k, v in character_data.items() 
                          if k in CHARACTER_FIELDS}
        domain_fields = {k: v for k, v in character_data.items() 
                        if k in DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_FIELDS}
        
        # Add domain fields to current_state
        universal_fields['current_state'] = domain_fields
        
        return self.engine.add_character(universal_fields)
```
