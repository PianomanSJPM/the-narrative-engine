## Overview
This document archives the comprehensive verification and policy for SoloHeart branding across the project, as of the latest review. It ensures all active code, UI, configuration, and documentation are consistently branded as "SoloHeart," with explicit constraints and future guidance.

---

## Branding Constraints & Policy

### 1. Preserve "The Narrative Engine"
- All references to "The Narrative Engine" are preserved and unmodified. No rebranding or renaming is to be performed for this system or its documentation.

### 2. Backend (`solo_heart/`)
- All active files use "SoloHeart" for branding.
- "SoloHeart Guide" replaces all instances of "Dungeon Master", "DM", or similar terms.
- Variable names use `guide_response`, `character_id="guide"`, etc., instead of legacy identifiers.

### 3. Frontend (`solo-heart-ui/`)
- "SoloHeart" appears in all titles, headers, and meta descriptions.
- "SoloHeart Guide" is used in tooltips, prompts, and sender labels.
- Badges updated from "DM" to "SH".
- `localStorage` and APIs use `soloheart-session`.

### 4. Config & Metadata
- All config and metadata files (e.g., `package.json`, `.env`, `README.md`) reflect SoloHeart branding.

### 5. No Old Terms in Active Content
- No references to "D&D", "5E", "Dungeon Master", "DM", or "Solo Adventure" remain in any active user-facing or LLM-facing content, logs, prompts, or session data.

### 6. Legacy, Test, or Archived Files
- Legacy, test, or archived files may still reference old branding. These are documented and excluded from future builds. No updates are required unless explicitly requested.

---

## Future Guidance
- **New files/modules:** Default to "SoloHeart" branding. Verify no conflict with "The Narrative Engine."
- **Restored legacy files:** Automatically flag for review to ensure SoloHeart consistency before inclusion in production.

---

## Status
**As of this verification, the active codebase is fully branded as "SoloHeart" and compliant with all above constraints.**

- All backend, frontend, config, and documentation files are clean of old branding.
- "The Narrative Engine" references are preserved.
- Legacy/test/archive files are documented and excluded from builds.
