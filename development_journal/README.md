# Development Journal System

A comprehensive development journal system for tracking the ongoing development of the SoloHeart DnD 5E AI-Powered Campaign Manager.

## Overview

The development journal system helps you track:
- **Progress entries** - What you've accomplished
- **Ideas** - New features and improvements
- **Bug fixes** - Issues resolved
- **Feature requests** - Planned enhancements
- **Design decisions** - Architectural choices
- **Milestones** - Development goals and deadlines
- **Time tracking** - Estimated vs actual hours

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Demo
```bash
python demo_dev_journal.py
```

This will create sample entries and show you how the system works.

### 2. Use the CLI
```bash
# Add a new journal entry
python dev_journal_cli.py add

# List recent entries
python dev_journal_cli.py list

# Search entries
python dev_journal_cli.py search

# View project summary
python dev_journal_cli.py summary

# List milestones
python dev_journal_cli.py milestones

# Create backup
python dev_journal_cli.py backup

# Export journal
python dev_journal_cli.py export
```

## Entry Types

- **PROGRESS** - Completed work and achievements
- **IDEA** - New feature ideas and concepts
- **BUG_FIX** - Issues resolved and fixes applied
- **FEATURE_REQUEST** - Planned features and enhancements
- **MILESTONE** - Major development milestones
- **REFACTOR** - Code refactoring and improvements
- **TESTING** - Testing activities and results
- **DOCUMENTATION** - Documentation updates
- **DESIGN_DECISION** - Architectural and design choices
- **NOTE** - General notes and observations

## Priority Levels

- **LOW** - Nice to have, not urgent
- **MEDIUM** - Standard priority
- **HIGH** - Important, should be done soon
- **CRITICAL** - Urgent, blocking other work

## Status Values

- **open** - Not started yet
- **in_progress** - Currently being worked on
- **completed** - Finished
- **blocked** - Waiting for something else

## Data Storage

The journal system stores data in the `development_journal/` directory:

- `entries.json` - All journal entries
- `milestones.json` - Development milestones
- `settings.json` - Journal configuration
- `backups/` - Automatic backup files

## Recent Major Milestones

### SoloHeart Project Cleanup and Enhanced Character Creation System (2025-07-04)
- **Project Cleanup**: Archived 50+ redundant files and 4 duplicate directories
- **Enhanced Character Creation**: LLM-powered extraction with immediate fact commitment
- **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time updates as player describes character
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama llama3 model for semantic understanding
- **UI Improvements**: Simplified flow and responsive design

### Key Features Implemented
- **LLM-Powered Extraction**: Uses Ollama's llama3 model for semantic understanding
- **Immediate Fact Commitment**: Facts committed directly to character sheet, no staging
- **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time updates with visual feedback
- **Robust Fallback**: Pattern matching when LLM extraction fails
- **Multi-Fact Extraction**: Extracts multiple character aspects simultaneously
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only commits high-confidence facts
- **Context Awareness**: Uses surrounding text to infer missing information

## Features

### Search and Filter
Search entries by:
- Text content (title and body)
- Entry type
- Priority level
- Status
- Tags
- Assignee

### Time Tracking
Track estimated vs actual hours for better project planning.

### Milestone Management
Create milestones and link entries to them for better project organization.

### Export and Backup
- Export the entire journal to JSON
- Automatic backups with timestamps
- Easy data portability

### Project Summary
Get an overview of:
- Total entries and their status
- Milestone progress
- Time tracking statistics
- Recent activity

## Integration

The development journal is designed to work alongside your existing SoloHeart project:

- Track development of the enhanced character creation system
- Document LLM integration improvements
- Plan new features for the campaign manager
- Monitor bug fixes and refactoring

## Example Usage

### Adding a Progress Entry
```python
from core.development_journal import DevelopmentJournal, JournalEntryType, Priority

journal = DevelopmentJournal()

entry = journal.add_entry(
    entry_type=JournalEntryType.PROGRESS,
    title="Implemented Enhanced Character Creation",
    content="Successfully implemented LLM-powered character creation with immediate fact commitment and live character sheet updates.",
    priority=Priority.HIGH,
    tags=["character-creation", "llm-integration", "ui-improvements"],
    related_files=["solo_heart/simple_unified_interface.py", "solo_heart/utils/ollama_llm_service.py"],
    assignee="Stephen",
    estimated_hours=5.0,
    actual_hours=3.0
)
```

### Creating a Milestone
```python
import datetime

milestone = journal.add_milestone(
    title="Enhanced Character Creation System",
    description="Complete LLM-powered character creation with live character sheet",
    target_date=datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
)
```

### Searching Entries
```python
# Find all LLM-related entries
llm_entries = journal.search_entries(tags=["llm-integration"])

# Find high priority items
high_priority = journal.search_entries(priority=Priority.HIGH)

# Find completed work
completed = journal.search_entries(status="completed")
```

## Current Project Status

### Completed Features
- ✅ **Project Cleanup**: Archived redundant files and simplified structure
- ✅ **LLM Integration**: Ollama llama3 model for semantic understanding
- ✅ **Enhanced Character Creation**: Multi-fact extraction with confidence scoring
- ✅ **Live Character Sheet**: Real-time updates with visual feedback
- ✅ **Immediate Fact Commitment**: No staging states, direct character sheet updates
- ✅ **UI Improvements**: Simplified flow and responsive design

### Development Statistics
- **Files Archived**: 50+ files and 4 directories
- **Archive Size**: ~100MB of redundant content
- **Development Time**: ~3 hours for cleanup and enhancements
- **Lines of Code**: ~2000 lines of enhanced character creation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of new features

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be Consistent** - Use the same tags and priorities consistently
2. **Update Regularly** - Add entries as you work, not just at the end
3. **Link Related Items** - Connect entries to milestones and related files
4. **Track Time** - Record estimated vs actual hours for better planning
5. **Use Tags** - Tag entries for easy searching and categorization
6. **Backup Regularly** - Use the backup feature to protect your data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the development journal:
- Web interface for easier management
- Integration with version control (Git)
- Time tracking integration
- Team collaboration features
- Export to various formats (PDF, Markdown)
- Integration with project management tools
